# unit1-homework-portfolio

## Description

This is the portfolio for the Unit 1 homework.
I only needed to use HTML and CSS for this particular oroject and it was a huge learning opportunity. This project is just to show off a little bit about me as well as showcase some of my accomplishments. It was a little bit of a challenge to format with CSS from scratch. I had to do a lot of playing around with certain properties to see what it would look like. I think I managed pretty well and had good resources and people to help me when I got stuck. Even after the struggles I managed to complete mhy first project.
